# PROSHIKA Helpdesk
Workspace for the PROSHIKA helpdesk solution. The `api` and `app` live in this repo; content mirrors the legacy project at `D:\Works\PROSHIKA_HELP_DESK\PROSHIKA_HELP_DESK`.

## Branches
- `api` — backend work.
- `app` — frontend/mobile work.
- `main` — stable integration.

## Structure
- `api/` — backend service placeholder.
- `app/` — frontend/mobile placeholder.

## Getting started
Pick a stack for each workspace, initialize it inside `api/` or `app/`, and push to the corresponding branch. Document environment variables in each subproject’s README.
