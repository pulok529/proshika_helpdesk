# PROSHIKA Helpdesk
Workspace for the PROSHIKA helpdesk solution. The `helpdeskapi` and `helpdeskapp` live in this repo; content mirrors the legacy project at `D:\Works\PROSHIKA_HELP_DESK\PROSHIKA_HELP_DESK`.

## Branches
- `main` — stable integration (create feature branches as needed).

## Structure
- `helpdeskapi/` — backend service placeholder.
- `helpdeskapp/` — frontend/mobile placeholder.

## Getting started
Pick a stack for each workspace, initialize it inside `helpdeskapi/` or `helpdeskapp/`, and push to the corresponding branch. Document environment variables in each subproject's README.
